            <h3>The Purge</h3>
            <h4>"Just Remember all the good the purge does"</h4>
            <p>Hope you found your why and you are now ready to move forward. Well its time to Purge!!! All that junk in your house must go. The honey buns in your night stand, TOSS THEM! The starburst jar on your desk, GIVE IT AWAY. I am so serious about this. Not having the trash available in your house to eat is one of the single most effective things you can do to keep yourself from eating it. On a cold winters morning I will surely eat the apple in my house rather than run to the store for high carb and high fat snacks. 
            Admittedly single people have the adventage here. Having a family that isn’t on a diet and them needing to hold on to their snacks is a difficult thing to cope with. I would then ask you to ask them to be supportive and perhaps they make some sacrifices to support you in your journey. If that doesn’t work ask them to hide their crap. 
            For those of you that are in this situation you are going to have to have a bit more self control than your single counter parts. So again it’s a matter of getting your house mates on board with a plan on how to keep you away from their food or minimizing the amount of “bad” food coming into the house.

                  <p>When first starting out on your fitness journey I would encourage you to understand what your Why is. Why do you want to do this? Do you simply want to look hot? Do you want to run a marathon? Do you want to get revenge on a ex who insulted you? The reason why this question is important is because if you are doing it for the wrong reasons the deck is already stacked against you and you will most likely fail. Sorry but that is just a fact. 
                  So what are the right reasons and what are the wrong reasons?  I suppose the best way to summarize that is whether the goals are intrinsic or extrinsic. Are they coming from within or without. People have a much better time achieving a goal when its intrinsic. When they want to do something simply because they want to do something without external influence. Wanting to look hot is not a bad thing when you just want to look hot. You look in the mirror and get a smug satisfaction at the image that is looking back at you. However wanting to make your ex drool on the other hand is not. Say that person moves away, or gets hit by a bus then your initial motivation is now gone. Next thing you know you wake up in a pile of pizza boxes not sure how you got there.  
                  So your homework would be figure out you why. Journal about it and do some soul searching and then when you feel like you are ready, come back here to understand how to get started. Go roam free and find your why!</p>
